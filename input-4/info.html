    <p>Undone: A story of Resilience: Most of us have grown up listening to the bedtime story of the rabbit and the tortoise. We recall that the tortoise was the hero. Besides being “slow and steady”, it won the race because it practiced resilience, as well – especially, as he saw the rabbit moving at a much faster speed.<br/><br/>Although resilience is a good quality, one must not always spring back into shape so quickly to put up a facade of being perfect. The capacity to recover quickly from difficulties is admirable, but one must not forget the beauty in brokenness.
