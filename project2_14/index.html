<div class="bubble-container align-left">
	<div class="box3">there are some punctuations that are interesting</div>
</div>

<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box3">and there are some punctuations that are not.</div>
</div>

<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box6">let us begin with the punctuations that are not. </div>
</div>

<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4">of these the one but the first and the most the completely most uninteresting is the question mark.</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="del">Delivered</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box3">the question mark is alright when it is all alone</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box5">when it is used as a brand on cattle</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box5">or when it could be used in decoration</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box7">but connected with writing it is completely entirely completely uninteresting. </div>
</div>

<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box8">it is evident that if you ask a question you ask a question</div>
</div>

<div class="date">02/05/2021, 5:57pm</div>
</div>


<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4">but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is a question as it is written in writing.</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box7">therefore i ask you therefore wherefore should one use the question mark.</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box7">beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box6">just an unnecessary name of something.</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box6">a question is a question, anybody can know that.</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box8">a question is a question and so why add to it the question mark when it is already there</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box3">when the question is already there in the writing</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4">therefore i never could bring myself to use a question mark, i always found it positively revolting, and now very few do use it. 
</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box6">exclamation marks have the same difficulty
</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4">and also quotation marks,they are unnecessary, they are ugly, they spoil the line of the writing or the printing and anyway what is the use

<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box10">if you do not know that a question is a question what is the use of its being a question.</div>
</div>

<div class="bubble-container align-right">
	<div class="box6">the same thing is true of a quotation.</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box7">when i first began writing i found it simply impossible to use question marks and quotation marks and exclamation points and now anybody sees it that way.</div> 
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box7">perhaps some day they will see it some other way but not at any rate anybody can and does see it that way. so there are the uninteresting things in punctuation uninteresting in a way that is perfectly obvious, and so we do not have to go any farther into that.</div> 
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4">one other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about and that is the apostrophe for possession.</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4">well feel as you like about that, i can see and i do see that for many that for some the possessive case apostrophe has a gentle tender insinuation that makes it very difficult to definitely decide to do without it. </div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4">one does do without it, i do, i mostly always do, but i cannot deny that from time to time i feel myself having regrets and from time to time i put it in to make the possessive case.  absolutely do not like it and leaving it out i feel no regret</div>

<div class="del">Delivered</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box3">perhaps it does appeal by its weakness to your weakness.</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box10">at least at any rate from time to time i do find myself letting it alone if it has come in and sometimes it has come in. </div>

</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box11">so now to come to the real question of punctuation</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box12"> periods, commas, colons, semi-colons and capitals and small letters.</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box6">i have had a long and complicated life with all these.</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4">let us begin with these i use the least first and these are colons and semi-colons, one might add to these commas.</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box13">when i first began writing, I felt that writing should go on, i still do feel that it should go on but when i first began writing I was completely possessed by the necessity that writing should go on and on and if writing should go on what had colons and commas to do with it</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box14">what had periods to do with it</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4">what had small letters and capitals to do with it to do with writing going on which was at that time the most profound need i had in connection with writing.</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4">what had colons and semi-colons to do with it what had commas to do with it what had periods to do with it. what had periods to do with it. </div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4">inevitably no matter how completely i had to have writing go on, physically one had to again and again stop sometime</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="del">Delivered</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box8"> sometime and if one had to again and again stop some time then periods had to exist.

<div class="date">02/07/2021, 8:15am</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box8"> beside i had always like the look of periods and i liked what they did.
</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4"> stopping sometime did not really keep one from going on, it was nothing that interfered, it was only something that happened
</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4"> and as it happened as a perfectly natural happening, i did not believe in periods and i used them. i really never stopped using them.
</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box14">i really never stopped using them.
</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box6"> beside that periods might later come to have a life of their own 
</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box6"> to commence breaking up things in arbitrary ways
</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box7">
 by the time i had written this poem about three years ago periods had come to have for me completely a life of their own.
</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box7"> they could begin to act as they thought best and one might interrupt one’s writing with them that is not really interrupt one’s writing with them
</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4">  but one could come to stop arbitrarily stop at times in one’s writing and so they could be used and you could use them 
</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4">periods could come to exist in this way and they could come in this way to have a life of their own.

<div class="box15">they did not serve you in any servile way as commas and colons and semi-colons do.

<div class="box14"> yes you do feel what I mean.

<div class="box16"> and that feeling that life that necessity that time can express itself in an infinite variety</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4"> that is the reason that i have always remained true to periods so much so that as i say recently i have felt that one could need them more than one had ever needed them.</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4"> you can see what an entirely different thing a period is from a comma, a colon or a semi-colon. </div>

<div class="del">Delivered</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box8"> there are two different way of thinking about colons and semicolons</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box8"> you can think of them as commas and as such they are purely servile or you can think of them as periods </div>

<div class="bubble-container align-left">

<div class="box17"> i can see that one might feel about them as periods but I myself never have </div>

<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4"> i began unfortunately to feel them as a comma and commas are servile they have no life of their own they are dependent upon use and convenience and they are put there just for practical purposes </div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box17"> semi-colons and colons had for me from the first completely this character </div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box7"> the character that a comma has and not the character that a period has and therefore and definitely i have never used them. </div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box7"> but now dimly and definitely i do see that they might well possibly they might have in them something of the character of the period and so it might have been an adventure to use them </div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box18">  i really do not think so. </div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box6">  i think however lively they are or disguised they are </div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box6">  they are definitely more comma than period </div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box6">  and so really I cannot regret not having used them.  </div>

<div class="box18"> what does a comma do.

<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box7"> i have refused them so often and left them out so much and did without them so continually that i have come finally to be indifferent to them.</div>

<div class="box5"> i do not now care whether you put them in or not</div>

<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4"> a comma by helping you along holding your coat for you and putting on your shoes keeps you from living your life as actively as you should lead it</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box6"> and to me for many years and i still do feel that way about it only now</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box6"> i do not pay as much attention to them, the use of them was positively degrading. </div>

<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box5"> let me tell you what i feel and what i mean and what i felt and what i meant.
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box16"> when i was writing those long sentences of The Making of Americans, verbs active present verbs with long dependent adverbial clauses became a passion with me.</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4"> i have told you that i recognize verbs and adverbs aided by prepositions and conjunctions with pronouns as possessing the whole of the active life of writing. 
 </div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box15"> complications make eventually for simplicity
 </div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box15"> and therefore i have always liked dependent adverbial clauses.
 </div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box12">  i have like dependent adverbial clauses because of their variety of dependence and independence.

<div class="box8">  you can see how loving the intensity of complication of these things that commas would be degrading.</div>

<div class="date">02/12/2021, 7:46am</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box7">  why if you want the pleasure of concentrating on the final simplicity of excessive complication would you want any artificial aid to bring about that simplicity.</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box6"> do you see now why I feel about that simplicity.
 </div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box6"> do you see now why I feel about the comma as i did and as i do.</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box6"> think about anything you really like to do and you will see what i mean.

<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box5">  when it gets really difficult you want to disentangle rather than to cut the knot</div>

<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box8"> at least of anybody feels who is working with any thread, so anybody feels who is working with any tool</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box8">so anybody feels who is writing any sentence or reading it after it has been written.</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box20"> and what does a comma do
</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4"> a comma does nothing but make easy a thing that if you like it enough is easy enough without the comma.

<div class="del">Delivered</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box21">a long complicated sentence should force itself upon you, make you know yourself knowing it and the comma, well at the most a comma is a poor period that lets you stop and take a breath but if you want to take a breath you ought to know yourself that you want to take a breath.</div>

<div class="date">02/13/2021, 8:09m</div>

<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box8">it is not like stopping altogether has something to do with going on</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4"> but taking a breath well you are always taking a breath and why emphasize one breath rather than another breath.
</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box16"> anyway that is the way i felt about it and i felt that about it very very strongly.
</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box6"> and so I almost never used a comma. 
</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box7">the longer, the more complicated the sentence the greater the number of the same kinds of words i had following one after another
</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-left">
<div class="box7">the more the very more i had of them the more I felt the passionate need of their taking care of themselves by themselves</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box17">  and not helping them, and thereby enfeebling them by putting in a comma.
</div>
</div>
<div class="bubble-container align-right">
<div class="box4"> so that is the way i felt about punctuation in prose, in poetry it is a little different but more so and later i will go into that.
