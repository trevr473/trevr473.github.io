<ul class="ingredients">
<li>Leftover rice</li>
<li>Three to four eggs</li>
<li>Chinkiang vinegar</li>
<li>light soy</li>
<li>Pinch salt</li>
<li>A good handful of green onions finely sliced, e.g. 1 oz</li>
<li>30ml veg oil, plus 1tbsp for egg</li>
</ul>

<ol class="instructions">
	<li>Whisk 3 eggs well before pouring them into a quite hot pan, which has a splash of veg oil. They will start frying up immediately, and begin to turn with a spatula so that the cooked parts are folded over as soon as they are done, allowing the liquid parts to reach the heat. Within 30 seconds all your egg should be cooked, break them up into larger or smaller pieces as desired. put egg back into its mixing container.
	</li>
	<li>Heat a good glug of oil (e.g. 1floz) in wok until shimmering but nowhere near smoking, and add green onions, and fry onions gently for at least 2min.
	</li>
	<li>Lower heat and stir if the onions look like they will brown. Add the loosened rice and toss/stir until well coated in the oil. (For crispier rice, add more oil in the beginning, press the rice down a little and wait a little longer, giving it lots of contact with the hot pan.) keep tossing til all the rice is well heated and softened, then add a good splash of soy sauce and keep tossing. Don't overdo the soy sauce, and add a pinch of salt to taste. the soy should lightly brown everything and be well distributed before you add the egg. Add the egg. Combine another 2min and serve.</li>
